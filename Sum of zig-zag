Input Format

Input consists of 2 integers and 1 2D array.
Integers corresponding to the size of rows and columns.


Output Format

The output prints the sum of the zig-zag pattern.
Refer to the sample output.
Note: Size of row and column should be same


Sample Input

3

3

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8 9



Sample Output

Sum of Zig-Zag pattern is 35
